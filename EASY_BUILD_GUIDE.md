## 🛠️ **Advanced Build Options**

### **Custom Build Commands**

```bash
# Windows - Console version (shows debug output)
pyinstaller --onefile --console app.py

# Windows - Single file (slower startup, but one file)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py

# Windows - Directory (faster startup, multiple files)
pyinstaller --onedir --windowed app.py

# Include custom icon
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=myicon.ico app.py
```

### **Using Python Setup Script**

```bash
# Build executable with setup.py
python setup.py build_exe

# Run tests before building
python setup.py test

# Clean build artifacts
python setup.py clean
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Build Issues**

**Problem**: "Python not found"
**Solution**: Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://python.org)

**Problem**: "PyInstaller failed"
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: "Missing modules"
**Solution**: The build script includes all needed modules automatically

### **Runtime Issues**

**Problem**: Executable won't start
**Solution**: 
- Run as Administrator (Windows)
- Check antivirus isn't blocking it
- Ensure port 3000 is available

**Problem**: "DLL load failed"
**Solution**: Install Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows)

## 📊 **File Sizes**

| Build Type | Approximate Size | Startup Time |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Single File (.exe)** | ~80-120 MB | 15-30 seconds |
| **Directory** | ~60-100 MB | 3-10 seconds |
| **With Assets** | ~150-200 MB | Varies |

**Note**: First startup is always slower as the executable extracts itself.

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **For Faster Sharing**
1. **Use directory build** instead of single file for faster startup
2. **Compress with 7-Zip** for smaller file sizes
3. **Upload to cloud storage** for easy sharing

### **For Better User Experience**
1. **Include clear instructions** in your zip file
2. **Test on different computers** before sharing
3. **Provide your contact info** for support

### **For Professional Distribution**
1. **Sign your executable** with a code signing certificate
2. **Create an installer** using NSIS or Inno Setup
3. **Add auto-update functionality**
